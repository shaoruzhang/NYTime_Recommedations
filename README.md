# NYTime_Recommedations
In this project, my goal was to scrape the data from a wikipedia table and utilize the NY Times API to recommend books to readers who may be interested in an author’s other best-seller books. 

I web-scraped and cleaned the data from “The New York Times Fiction Best Sellers of 2020” wikipedia page.
